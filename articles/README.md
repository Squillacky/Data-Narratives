Just like your technical projects, each piece of content needs a README to explain its purpose.

Navigate into the podcasts folder.

Click Add file -> Create new file.

Name the file README.md.

In this file, write up the "show notes" for your podcast: a title, a brief description of the topics covered, and a direct link to the audio file.

Repeat this process for the articles folder, creating a README that gives a brief introduction to your story.
